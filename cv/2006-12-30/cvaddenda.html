Or, more broadly, practices that enable us to experience abundance and meaningful responsibility rather than scarcity and coercion or false, empty freedom. These are practices which enable us to enhance the relationships by which we are sustained. These relationships include: our relationships with our minds and with our mental tools; our relationships with our bodies; our relationships with our built environments; our relationships with our families and with our friends, and our relationships with those who are not yet our friends; our relationships with our own cultures and our relationships with the cultures from which we have the most to learn; our relationships with the stars, the atmosphere, the waters, and the land;c7 and our relationships with the communities of our landbase&mdash;communities of bacteria, fungi, plants, insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, and of all the other organisms&mdash;by which we are sustained. The practices I am interested in additionally enable us to turn sites of damage into places of healing and of new cultural growth. The practices I am interested in also enable us to prevent such damage from ever occurring. The destruction of individuals, of cultures, and of species due to encroachment on their persons or on their landbases by humans seeking to extract physical, cultural, or spiritual resources&mdash;as, to give one example, is occurring in the poisoning of the landbase of the Huaorani of the Amazonian Ecuador due to drilling for oil&mdash;need not occur. We can protect, respect, and nourish the landbase which sustains us. We can experience abundance and meaning without destroying the sustenance of others.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Teaching Interests</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Working with others to practice, develop, and grow awareness of permaculture practices.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">What Is the Best Teaching You Have Ever Done?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The best teaching I have ever done has been in loving other people&mdash;and in all that went into their feeling that they now knew love&mdash;providing them with memories that help them to create again experiences of similar or better quality.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">What Is the Best Teaching You Have Ever Experienced?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When a girl when I was in second and third grade helped me feel great love&mdash;and when others have done the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">What About Classroom Teaching?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The greatest teaching was not in classrooms. The greatest living engages the whole of me. The best teaching is in beautiful places where my senses are not shut down trying to avoid noise, polluted air, or polluted social relations&mdash;rather, my senses are open wide by my interest or by the force of the input.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ah&mdash;the greatest classroom teaching I have experienced was in the dance studio&mdash;or even in the physics lecture hall or lab (or while working through the problems in a quiet library)&mdash;where truly miraculous phenomena and experiences were shared. I am not still in the dance studio because my mind wanted to explore more and in a different way. I have gone too far the other way, and will now be finding a new balance between the experiential qualities of the dance studio, the contemplation of literature, the ecovillage, music, the study of physics, activism, and of continuing to have food and shelter.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">What Does That Balance Look Like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It looks like me growing more plants at the least, and developing my music and movement practices more than I have been. It looks like me working with others to create pleasant, nourishing environments in which to live and to have adventures.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Try Again: What Is the Best Classroom Teaching You Have Ever Done?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">An example comes from the first week of Leadership Camp. One afternoon, after camp was over, a counselor mentioned that Andrew had been snapping his towel at James. He had done this at lunchtime, in front of younger campers. I decided to address this with Andrew and the other Junior Leaders. I wanted to do so, however, in a way that would foreground that &ldquo;Leadership is communicating to people their worth and potential so clearly that they come to see it in themselves.&rdquo; This definition, from Stephen Covey&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Eighth Habit</span><span class="c2">,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">I had shared on the first day of camp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was during my stand-like-a-tree meditation the following morning that I formulated a ceremony in which I could model and have the campers practice this principle. The first step was to make each part of the definition clear. I did this by asking them to write in silence about a time when they had felt awe, which was explained and restated as amazement, wonder, and deep appreciation. They should be willing to share what they wrote with the class. After writing, I paired with one of the campers, Trevor, and asked the others to find partners as well, and we shared our moments of awe. Trevor felt awe when he first saw his new puppy. As I shared my moment with Trevor, the room fell silent to listen. Later, I asked for volunteers to share what their partners had told them. I asked them to keep that feeling in their minds as we went on to the next step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I then wrote &ldquo;I affirm your worth and potential&rdquo; on the whiteboard, and stepped the campers through each word, making sure &ldquo;affirm&rdquo; was understood, as well as &ldquo;worth&rdquo; and &ldquo;potential.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">You have a worth regardless of what you do. Some people even say that serial killers or mass murderers have this worth. Some people say that God sees this worth in everyone, and some people themselves try to see that worth in everyone. That you have &ldquo;worth&rdquo; is related to the idea of unconditional love, which some people say parents should have for their children. It means that no matter what you do, they will still love you. Your &ldquo;potential&rdquo; is what you can become. If you are surrounded by people who express that you have worth, who affirm your worth, you are helped to grow and to continue to become more capable and able to make decisions about your life and your world that you could not previously make.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The words having been given meaning, we began the final part.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">All twelve campers, myself, and two other counselors stood up, forming a circle around the tables, and I asked for a volunteer. Austin volunteered. I then explained what he would be doing. He would walk around the circle, stopping in front of each person. He would grasp that person&rsquo;s hand and look into her or his eyes, and looking at that person, he would bring to mind that feeling of awe that he had written about, and do his best to feel awe&mdash;amazement, wonder, deep appreciation&mdash;at witnessing this person. He would shake this person&rsquo;s hand and in his mind say and feel the words, &ldquo;I affirm your worth and potential.&rdquo; Then he would do the same for the next person, all the way around the circle. I asked if Austin was still up for going first, and he said he was. I mentioned that some people don&rsquo;t like the handshake&mdash;&ldquo;is anyone not OK with it?&rdquo; There weren&rsquo;t objections, so we went ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This was enormously difficult. And long: fifteen people each greeting fifteen people, each person walking the circle by her or himself, pausing to look into the eyes and to shake the hand of each person in the circle. Austin might not have been the best choice to have go first&mdash;he, one of the younger campers, giggled most of the way around. Everyone was to remain silent during the entire go-around. When the last person had finished, I had so much pent-up tension myself that I led the group in a group yell. . . and probably shouted the loudest. We took a break, and I then explained that&mdash;in their every action with the campers who[m] they would be counselors for&mdash;I wanted them to keep this greeting in their minds, and that I would be doing my best to do the same in all my interactions with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I next told them I was about to take an unusual step, but that I thought it was best, and that they and I could consider afterward if it was a good thing to do. I then explained the comments I had received about a camper in our group&mdash;Andrew&mdash;and what it meant for our camp that people were noticing us, not as good role models, but as poor ones. And I asked them all to consider how we all lead by modeling. I closed by mentioning that it is a principle, written in their manuals and taught to the camp counselors, not to address the problems of one camper in front of the other campers. At this time, however, I felt it was best for all of us for me to do it this way, and I had done my best to create a space in which I could talk with Andrew about what had happened both in front of the group and in a way in which I was affirming his worth and potential. I had also hoped this approach would not increase the resistance of Andrew, who, of all the campers, most resisted participating, thereby increasing the tendency of others to resist. In avoiding aggravating his resistance, at least, I was successful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The ceremony was repeated in the second week. I won&rsquo;t go so far as to say it thoroughly transformed our relationships with each other, but perhaps it has transformed our greetings. Should it happen that I see one of these campers or counselors at the Kroc Center and we greet each other, we remember affirming each other&rsquo;s worth and potential, and perhaps we remember feeling awe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I later read, in Starhawk&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">The Spiral Dance,</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the importance of grounding any magic or power created in a ceremony at the end of the ceremony, something I did not do very gracefully the first time I tried this. The moment of awe I described to Trevor was when I was looking at a photo on kenwilber.com captioned, &ldquo;This photo was taken . . . shortly after an eleven-day &lsquo;constant consciousness&rsquo; realization. . .&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">My recall of this incidence of classroom teaching followed from considering an occurrence on Tuesday of this week in my RWS class. I noticed a group of students had gotten off topic in a group discussion. I joined them and began to discuss the topic with one of the students in the group, and, after a bit, the whole class stopped to listen. That class was one of the best of the semester. Michael Brandwein was the first to make me aware of this tendency of people to pay more attention when eavesdropping on a conversation than when they are being spoken to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A final example of memorable classroom teaching I have been responsible for was when I taught computer skills to fourth and fifth graders. I believed very much in the importance of the skills I was teaching. I did not give grades, but instead developed a large chart by which students could mark their progress through the levels of the typing program and through the computer art, interactive fiction, and programming projects I found for them to work on once typing was mastered. In addition, I manufactured covers from cardboard boxes to place over the keyboards and their hands so that they could not see either their hands or the keyboards as they tried to pass a typing level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Four or five years later when I returned to Monterey after having gone to college, I ran into the librarian from that elementary school, and she asked if I was teaching. &ldquo;You are a natural,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was a line of demarcation between the students too old to have been in your class, and those too young. Only your students tested out of typing class in junior high.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">I just remembered. The Meaning in Life Forum was in a classroom too, but I altered the ambiance by bringing in incandescent floor lighting. And often there were only four of us.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Selected Indicators</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just as nations need to measure success by a metric different from the GDP, so do individuals need to communicate their success differently than what may appear on the traditional r&eacute;sum&eacute;. I do not yet have a clear theoretical basis for the selection of these indicators, other than to address some areas of success and some areas of shortcoming.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">(</span><span class="c0">for the past year</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;unless stated otherwise)</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Average hugs per week: Four.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Letters written to relatives: Ten.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Letters written: Twenty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days when at least some time was spent with at least one relative: 330.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days per week in which I walked with a friend: Two.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Months since last car ride: Three.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Years since drove a car: Twelve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Air travel one way since 1998: 2001, four flights; 2003, two flights; 2006, one flight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dollars spent directly on war since 2002: Zero.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Cash spent on CSU Tuition since 2003: $8,600.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nights spent sleeping out of doors: 25.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bicycle camping trips: Two, for two nights.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days spent walking: Eight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days spent walking where there was no pavement visible the entire day: Zero.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days when I could not breathe deeply due to a passing car or diesel truck: 365.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days when helicopters flew or hovered overhead: 320.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days when neighbor was heard screaming at her children: 330.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days when peace was disturbed by engine- and car-related sounds or by amplified sound: 360.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Cash spent on housing-related costs since 2003: $40.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days per week I walked through the canyon (since August): Five.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nights I walked through the canyon in the moonlight: At least four.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Mornings per week I experienced dawn in the canyon: At least two.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Legislation passed: None.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dams removed: None.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Roads narrowed: None.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Roads removed: None.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Pavement removed: None.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Carfree areas created: None.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Carfree areas protected from encroachment: None.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Composting toilets built or installed: None.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days spent where English is a foreign language: 0.5.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Languages spoken: Two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Languages read: Three.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Books read in Spanish, not for school: .25.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days spent in intentional communities: Twelve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">People of preindustrial culture met and learned from: One.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Hours per day spent on integral personal practice: 0.5 on average.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">People introduced to the concept of a personal practice who are known to now be consciously developing theirs: Two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Entire days spent sitting or laying still for far too long, reading or writing: Ten.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days per week did kata (morning exercises) in nearby canyon: Two (since August).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days per week I swam: Two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Days per week I lifted weights: Two.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Percent of nutrition from personally harvested, foraged food: Two percent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Food foraged in estimated order of quantity:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">Figs (black mission, calimyrna, and others).
