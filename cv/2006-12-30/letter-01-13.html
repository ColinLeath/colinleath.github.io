	I look forward to spending an intense six weeks this summer as a
Teaching Assistant at TIP with some of the best students and
instructors I have yet had opportunity to study with. I know what it
is like to be among gifted students, since I attended a selective
high school. I am now a master&rsquo;s student in English and
Comparative Literature at San Diego State University. To TIP I bring
my experience as a facilitator and as a student and my interest in
community.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	For the past two years, I have been fortunate to work as a Challenge
Course Facilitator. My role is to present activities that stress
particular areas of team or individual development. In Group Jump
Rope, for example, each person in sequence must jump the rope once
without a beat being missed. Success requires that the group accept
and organize around members&rsquo; abilities to jump and swing the
rope. The programs I have facilitated have had as participants
Brownie Girl Scouts, graduates of YMCA Youth &amp; Family Services
courses, UCLA medical residents, KPMG accountants, gung-ho
franchisees, Mormon youth, and High-Tech High students, among others.
I also designed and led programs for a Girl Scout troop, a student
advisory board, and a volleyball team, and I co-led a <I>Fear
Factor-</I>themed summer camp.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	As a student, I have transitioned from science and engineering to
the humanities. My years in high school were not the best of my life.
As an undergraduate, I considered how those years could be improved.
I researched identity development and <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">optimal
experience.</SPAN> For my thesis, I created the Meaning in Life
Forum, offered it through the University of Washington&rsquo;s
Experimental College, and evaluated its effect on participants&rsquo;
experiences of meaning in life. If I, having many advantages, free to
do almost anything, to live nearly anywhere, and with the ability to
succeed in many fields, could not find meaning, then hollow is the
freedom so many others wish they had. Since that time, I have
practiced dance, the violin, and joined a choir.<SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
I advocated living without cars. I visited ecovillages and resided in
different cities, eventually moving, by bicycle, to where I am near
relatives. I did all that to create a more responsive and rewarding
place in which to live. I focus on literature now to learn to express
visions others will value, and because I enjoy exploring realms texts
call forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	Desire for health, growth, and vitality that spring because of, not
in spite of, the prevailing weather and quality of soil feeds this
application and my learning how to nourish fertile land.
Communication, or making common, or sharing, including the effort to
truly understand what is shared, is central to growth, suggest
philosopher J&uuml;rgen Habermas and author Stephen Covey. Looking
for life-fostering community, I lived at Earthaven Ecovillage for two
months; there I learned about heartshares, Open Space Technology, and
consensus minus one. I visited Madre Grande Monastery, Shakti Rising,
and The Farm Community. I lived with Quakers and attended Friends&rsquo;
meetings. I participated in the third Toward Car-Free Cities
conference, and I helped organize several <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>Ishmael</I></SPAN>
and Integral Transformative Practice groups.</P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	I can, therefore, contribute to courses in wisdom, utopian dreams,
and leadership. However, because I am training to teach the subjects,
and wish to learn them better myself, I would especially like to
assist courses in writing and literature. There are other areas I
have less experience in, but would still be able to contribute to,
given that I have three school-free weeks to prepare prior to the
start of your first term. I have enclosed a list of some of the
courses that interest me.</P>
