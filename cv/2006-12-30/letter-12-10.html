	Since I applied last year I have had many experiences that should
serve me well when working with you as an Instructor or as a Teaching
Assistant next summer:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	I co-led a group of twelve eighth graders from Polytechnic School in
	Pasadena on a week-long backpacking and kayaking trip in Big Sur and
	Monterey, California.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	I continued designing and leading team-building programs as a Lead
	Facilitator at the Kroc Center. For one of the programs I led, I
	worked with seven other facilitators to serve a group of 100 high
	school students. While doing so, I achieved a personal leadership
	goal: to have a lot of fun while successfully managing a large
	program.</P>
	<LI VALUE=1><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	I designed and led two sessions of Junior Leaders Camp for campers
	ages 13-17 who wished to become counselors and volunteer counselors
	at the Kroc Center Summer Camps. The first week we had twelve
	campers, and the second, seventeen. My design of this camp benefited
	enormously from Michael Brandwein&rsquo;s <I>Learning Leadership</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
	lent to me by the camp director. An innovation I came up with on my
	own, however, was a key part of the success of the camp: I required
	students to lead our class in at least one camp game (excluding
	traditional sports). In addition, I created a manual for the camp
	containing information volunteer counselors should have and a list
	of games for them to refer to. One camper said she preferred our
	camp to a YMCA leadership camp she had attended because we did many
	more fun activities and because we practiced leadership skills by
	leading. Also, some campers wrote in their evaluations that they
	learned they could lead. I have included a short version of the
	schedule for the second camp session to give you an idea of what I
	planned.</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.06in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	I am currently teaching Freshman composition, RWS 100: The Rhetoric
	of Written Argument, to a class of 25 students at SDSU. Over the
	course of the semester I have developed practices which meet the
	desires for effective instruction as well as for joy of the
	students, myself, and the department. Even so, I am looking forward
	to a smaller paper load and freedom from the need to mitigate
	negative effects of the grading system.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.06in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
	In the courses I am taking for my TESOL (Teaching English to
	Speakers of Other Languages) certificate, I have learned theories
	and practices applicable to many teaching settings. I have been able
	to test some of these ideas in the RWS course I teach. The use of
	portfolios is one example of a technique we have covered that has
	been a success in my RWS class.

Based on these experiences and on the self-reflection elicited by
reapplying to your program, I have decided to apply to be an
Instructor or a Teaching Assistant primarily for your Leadership
Institute. The emphases of your Institute on service-learning and on
developing students&rsquo; &ldquo;commitments to service,
philanthropy, and civic engagement&rdquo; are consistent with my view
that the best education is project-based and learner-directed. That
you are encouraging each student to develop her or his own legacy
project particularly interests me. Further, of all that you offer I
may have the most to contribute to the Leadership Institute because
of the work I have done as a Facilitator. I am also eager to consider
assisting other courses, Institutes, and Field Studies, as I specify
in my position preferences. Revising my curriculum vitae set me on an
absorbing journey, part of which involved compiling a brainstorm,
which I have included, of courses I would like to help with were TIP
to offer them. Also, please note that I have a driver&rsquo;s license
and I am willing to drive.</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal; line-height: 100%; widows: 0; orphans: 0">
I look forward to working with you.</P>
