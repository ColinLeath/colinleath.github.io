</li></ul>The closest experience I&#39;ve had to teaching the Teen Academy has been designing and teaching the leadership camp (ages 14-17) at the Kroc Center in 2006 for two one-week sessions. Here are some compliments from the students (from an <a href="http://j9k.freehostia.com/cv/2006-12-30/letter-12-10.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">earlier cover letter</a>):<br>
<blockquote>One camper said she preferred our camp to a YMCA leadership camp she had attended because we did many more fun activities and because we practiced leadership skills by leading. Also, some campers wrote in their evaluations that they learned they could lead.<br>
</blockquote>I have also taught a semester of <a href="http://j9k.freehostia.com/rws100/index.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">RWS 100</a> at SDSU, but decided to get out of grad school and focus on earth care, gardening, and spending more time in the wilderness--and that about accounts for all of 2007.<br>
<br>With respect to my knowledge of the subject area and the objectives of the Academy (<br><ul><li>Build a Multimedia Web Site</li><li>Learn coding, podcasting, blogging, and videocasting.</li><li>Design your own web site. ),<br>
</li></ul>my main paid professional experience before 2003 was as a programmer. In my free time, since 1995, I have designed and maintained several sites:<br><ul><li>Most recently, <a href="http://sdtjdph.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">SD/TJ Design, Plant, Harvest</a>, and thirteen or so other blogs, most of which are listed in <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/12776582287215819287" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">my blogger profile</a>.</li>

</li></ul>I&#39;d like to just let that work speak for itself, and I haven&#39;t updated my old resume because I can&#39;t think of a better way to share my current orientation and projects than by pointing people to <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/12776582287215819287" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">the blogger profile</a>. The most recently active project there has been <a href="http://sdprim.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">SD Origin Skills</a> (I just helped organize a primitive skills gathering near Fallbrook).<br>
<br>My current project is to equip myself with a mobile Internet connection that will let me blog and browse and recruit others while living in the Los Padres National Forest, north of Santa Barbara.<br><br>I&#39;d be happy to sketch up a curriculum for this academy prior to the interview. <br>
<br>I&#39;m not sure how much technical detail to go into here. You&#39;ll probably note I haven&#39;t been graphics-intense. Here is some of the graphic design work I&#39;ve done:<br><ul><li><a href="http://cfu.freehostia.com/Members/colin/carfreechic/index.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">The carfree patch</a></li>

</ul>I do have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/colinleath" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/group/sdtjdph" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">group</a>, and <a href="http://e-a.freehostia.com/cleath/c348.html#501" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">one published sound recording</a>. The <a href="http://j9k.freehostia.com/b/test_2008-03-18-0440.html" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">AJAX video slideshow I created</a> is something special you&#39;ll probably not find anywhere else besides the SDTJDPH blog. And regarding teaching success and enthusiasm in this subject area, one of the best jobs I ever had was teaching typing, programming, and computer applications to 4th and 5th graders back in 1995. Almost all of my students tested out of keyboarding in junior high, while few of those before and after me did.<br>
<br></font>My general approach is to let students work at a particular challenge that motivates them, and then provide more formal instruction based on what they most want to help them succeed. For example: on the first day I can step students through creating a blog. After some freedom working on that, they may be more open to learning about feed burning and reading--or perhaps media recording. I can develop a set of modules that we&#39;ll cover, but the order and depth of coverage can flow from student interest in their projects.<br>
<br>My current focus has been on demonstrating the read/write web technology and on encouraging people to use it to collaborate to better care for the space we share. Helping develop new content publishers by teaching this camp is aligned with that goal. My background in experiential education, my experience with and interest in this age group, and my deeper motivation to help more people in this region develop both awareness and voice all will help me do this.<br>
<br>Furthermore, I have an enormous amount to learn from the Academy participants in this subject area--as part of my upcoming adventure I&#39;ll be learning more about content creation on and for mobile platforms (cell phones, PDAs), which they may know well. In fact, they may be so experienced that we can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">open space techniques</a> to structure the camp and have students leading multiple--perhaps even simultaneous--workshops. If we have enough computers, conceivably I could facilitate a week-long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">bar camp</a> for a large number of high schoolers.<br>
<br>If you haven&#39;t already done so, advertising this opportunity through nearby <a href="http://platt.edu/" target="_blank" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Platt College</a> may bring you other qualified candidates.<font color=#550055><br>
