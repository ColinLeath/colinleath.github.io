<p>Affirmations</p>
<ol>
Current (2003-04-09-2339) affirmations and visualizations for my external self (following the example of <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/itpnyc/">ITP</a> -- I think the ITP as presented in _the life we are given_ is too socially conservative, and should incorporate a focus on social change beyond what occurs primarily within the individual):
<li>The population of the world is not increasing.</li>
<li>There are no cars.</li>
<li>People do things because they want to, not because they have to.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
Affirmations &amp; visualizations for my self:
<li>My entire being is vital, balanced, and healthy.</li>
<li>My eyes and nose feel cool, calm, and relaxed-- a blue, clearness.</li>
<li>I do my weights (<a href="http://joycevedral.com/">joyce vedral</a>) daily (with rest one day/week).</li>
<li>I steadily, and with focus, progress on my projects (see above) working on them at least 8 hrs / day.</li>
<li>By November of this year (2003) I will either be some place where the temperature does not (except rarely) fall below 5 degrees celsius, or I will have solid plans in place to be there shortly.</li>
<li>I will be continuing to further define and manifest / realize / create the kind of environment I shall love to live in-- currently I am visualizing a carfree ecovillage in a warm place where I grow food, have an internet connection, and can sleep outside.</li>
<li>I continue to practice dance, and flexibility, and to dream of the violin, daily.</li>
<li>I continue doing all the good things I was doing before I started formally making affirmations and visualizing the desired state.</li>
<li>I make more of an effort to do the ITP kata, with an emphasis on the relaxation and transformational imaging parts, and possibly meditation.</li>

</ol>
<ol>
Older affirmations (continuing):
<li>My joints (shoulders, wrists, knees), feel strong, and can move without pain. (I had bad RSI- but with resuming weight training, finding a keyboard I could use (<a href="http://www.grandtec.com/">VIC</a>), and using the computer less (I joined choirs) -- I'm doing better.</li>
<li>Not a day goes by that I do not eat a vegetable and / or a fruit, with a strong emphasis on variety.</li>
<li>I shall be ready to sleep by 10pm every night, though I'm allowed two exceptions per week.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
Realized affirmations:
<li> (first formally affirmed in January, 2003) By November of this year, I will have made a significant life change, that may involve leaving NYC, but at the least will involve transitioning to doing work on projects not my own for no more than two hours / weekday (down from four hours / weekday).
<p>This affirmation has been realized. Currently (2003-04-09-2352) I live with my parents, working for them approx. 10 hrs / week, buying food and high-deductable health insurance from savings that should last a year.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol>
Long-term goals, not fully affirmed, (because I am unclear?):<a name="goalslt"></a>
<li>I shall not pay for war / I shall make as little taxable income as possible. (this is partially realized). I shall not be taxed. (this relates to external self affirmation #3). I shall not pay rent. I shall have minimial physical posessions. I shall be proficient in living in the wilderness. My primary goal is experienceart. I love living.</li>
<li>I need fewer affirmations, or a better way of defining my practice/ separating out the affirmations, so that I have the few most important to focus on, while still ensuring I maintain valued practices. What is most important?</li>
</ol>
