<p>I especially wish to advertise this service in <a href="http://communities.ic.org/">Communities Magazine</a> because I've learned so much from my time at communities in the past--<a href="http://earthaven.org/">Earthaven</a>, <a href="http://quailsprings.org/">Quail Springs</a>, and permaculture gatherings (<a href="http://southeasternpermaculture.org/">SE</a>, <a href="http://socalconvergence.org/">SoCal</a>), and <a href="http://plantsandhealers.com/">Frank Cook</a> in particular.</p>
<p>Group size: 1 to 6 participants</p>
<p>Length: 24 hours to 2 weeks</p>
<p>What this may look like:</p>
<p>We select a place in the wilderness were we can sit relatively undisturbed for the length of the solo. We hike to a central point in the woods/desert/beach together. We may camp and eat together the first evening. The next morning we select spots out of sight but perhaps within sound of each other. We go to those spots. I remain at a central point in case you have difficulties or first aid needs. You can also shout your name and others can shout your name once they hear you and I can help you that way. I can also bring you food, uncooked or cooked (you provide food, big enough pot, etc. to do the cooking) or reading/writing material at intervals throughout the solo.</p>
<p>When solo is over, we meet and return to town/city/village perhaps after or while sharing stories about some of what happened or what we noticed during our solos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming someday:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testimonials, video testimonials</li>
<li>Descriptions of past solos</li>
<li>photos</li>
</ul>
<p>Why you'd benefit from my help with your solo:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can help you choose a peaceful location you'll be comfortable in</li>
<li>I can help you bring gear and food that will help you be comfortable</li>
<li>I can bring the first aid kit and help plan for emergencies and medical needs that could occur (I have Wilderness First Responder training)</li>
<li>I can provide some background on what people might use their sit spot/solo for.</li>
<li>I can cook for you and bring you food and/or water.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also especially enjoy planning and doing solos where we can get to the solo site without using cars--so by hiking, biking, kick scooter, or bus or train.</p>
<p>I have facilitated solos from 3 hours to 72 hours in the San Juan Islands, Joshua Tree National Park and San Juan National Forest (the Colorado Plateau). I continue to explore the country and world and may already know of a good place for solos near you.</p>
<p>Why do this? You'll learn and practice that wherever there is wilderness you have a home. (and other reasons)</p>

<p>12/2/2011: Here's the ad I placed in _Communities Magazine_:</p>
<blockquote>Spend time alone with others in the woods! 24hrs to two weeks. Solo /

<p>I've also considered advertising in _Adventure Cycling_</p>

The following quote by Dimnet speaks to my motivation for doing and facilitating solos:
<blockquote>There is in every man a feeling of enmity to things whether they happen or only exist. We hate the crowded, confused lumber-room where no motion is free, we want to push rubbish out of our sight and reduce objects to a minimum as the Carthusian does in his white cell with just a plain black cross on the wall. The notion of a vacuum is repellent to us, but let enough appear round us and above us to create the idea of a shelter and we breathe freely and happily. We "find ourselves" as the phrase goes, our poor, neglected self, dearest of friends, yet dragged along everywhere like an ill-treated dog, hardly every spoken to or taken notice of, going where it listeth not, till at last the unnaturalness of it all appears, and, for a few hours, we live instead of just being alive. (_The Art of Thinking_, Ernest Dimnet, p. 92, 1928)
