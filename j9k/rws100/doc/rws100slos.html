  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>RWS 100 Student Learning Outcomes</b></p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The following four outcomes describe the four
  main writing projects or "assignment types" for the course. Students will be
  able to:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">construct an account of an author&rsquo;s project
    and argument; translate an argument into their own words;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">construct an account of an author&rsquo;s project
    and argument and carry out small, focused research tasks to find
    information that helps clarify, illustrate, extend or complicate that
    argument; use appropriate reference materials, including a dictionary, in
    order to clarify their understanding of an argument;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">construct an account of two or more
    authors&rsquo; projects and arguments and explain rhetorical strategies that
    these authors--and by extension other writers--use to engage readers in
    thinking about their arguments;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Construct an account of two author&rsquo;s
    projects and arguments in order to use concepts from one argument as a
    framework for understanding and writing about another.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The following points describe outcomes to
  work on throughout the semester, to be attained over the 15 weeks. Students
  will be able to:</p>

  <ol start="5">
   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">describe elements of an argument--claims,
    methods of development, kinds of evidence, persuasive appeals; annotate
    the work that is done by each section of a written argument;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">use all aspects of the writing
    process--including prewriting, drafting, revising, editing, and
    proofreading;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">choose effective structures for their
    writing, acknowledging that different purposes, contexts and audiences
    call for different structures; understand the relationship between a
    text's ideas and its structure;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">identify devices an author has used to
    create cohesion or to carry the reader through the text; use metadiscourse
    to signal the project of a paper, and guide a reader from one idea to the
    next in their writing;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">effectively select material from written
    arguments, contextualize it, and comment on it in their writing;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">determine when and where a source was
    published, who wrote it and whether it was reprinted or edited; understand
    that texts are written in and respond to particular contexts, communities
    or cultures; examine the vocabulary choices a writer makes and how they
    are related to context, community or culture, audience or purpose;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">respond in writing to ideas drawn from
    various cultures and disciplines, using the activity of writing to clarify
    and improve their understanding of an argument;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">analyze and assess arguments made by visual
    texts; incorporate visual images into their documents;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">edit their writing for the grammar and
    usage conventions appropriate to each writing situation;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">assign significance to the arguments that
    they read;</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">reflect on how they wrote their papers, and
    revise arguments and findings based on critical reflection.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
