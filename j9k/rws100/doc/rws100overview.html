<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >RWS 100/101, The Rhetoric of
Written Argument, satisfies the composition component of the
university requirement in Communication and Critical Thinking. Other
courses which satisfy this requirement are Africana Studies 120,
Chicana/Chicano Studies 11B, and Linguistics 100.</FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >RWS 100 is an introduction
to writing and reading as critical inquiry, focusing on the rhetoric
of written argument. The course is designed to help university
students successfully undertake writing projects that have the depth
and complexity of university-level work. By the end of the course,
students should be able to identify and analyze features of written
arguments and to write an argument about problems or questions
addressed in the course. They should be able to write and revise
papers in which they address complex questions effectively, use
source materials responsibly, and make sound decisions about
structure, cohesion and conventions of correctness. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >Instructors usually require
4&ndash;5 pages of writing each week during the semester. This
writing includes responses to readings, drafts and revisions of
papers, and timed writing done during class. The writing leads to a
collection of four finished papers. These include one of each of the
following types of assignments: (1) argument analysis; (2) gathering
information and managing sources; (3) proposing an explanation; (4)
reading in new contexts. The final exam may be (5) a reflection or
critical analysis of the student&rsquo;s own writing over the course
of the semester. (A description of these assignment types follows the
course criteria.)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >RWS 100 is built on the
following premise: when writing provides occasion for inquiry, it
helps to improve a writer&rsquo;s understanding of the information
being investigated. As John Gage has said, &ldquo;This is the most
significant sense in which writing is a way of learning.&rdquo;
Writing, he suggests, &ldquo;causes one to need to clarify
information,&rdquo; to put ideas into relationships, and &ldquo;to
explore reasons for saying what one has decided to say&rdquo; (730).
In this sense, writing and reading are mutually dependent activities.
It should not go without saying that good writers are also good
readers&mdash;of their own and others&rsquo; texts.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >Given these starting points,
and because RWS 100 reflects the demands of writing in the
university, students are asked to write frequently and on issues of
complexity and interest. They are asked to do a significant amount of
reading, to explore that reading in writing, and to write about
problems and themes that the class is investigating together.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >The recommended textbooks
for teaching RWS 100 include writing assignments based on complex
readings from a variety of disciplines. The books were chosen very
carefully not only for these readings, which provide appropriate
themes around which to organize the writing course, but also for
their assignments, which support the goals of RWS 100 classes.
Instructors will notice that the textbooks offer sequences or
clusters of activities. These sequences establish relationships among
the readings and provide incrementally complex writing tasks which
ask students to re-think earlier material in the light of later
readings. The books offer instructors the opportunity to select and
focus on particular themes, and they model how to design classroom
activities and writing assignments around those themes. In other
words, it is not necessary for instructors to invent classroom
activities, reading assignments linked to writing, or paper topics <I>ex
nihilo</I>. The best instructors are careful readers who use and
adapt the assignments in the book. Instructors hand out a written
copy of the assignment to the class rather than relying on oral
instructions.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >RWS 100 requires students to
write every week, both in class and outside of class, in a variety of
ways&mdash;making notes, working at difficult ideas, drafting and
revising, amplifying, and recasting. Students are encouraged to
discover in their reading the claims and reasons of other writers,
and to be able to articulate them, as Kenneth Burke says, &ldquo;without
heckling.&rdquo; They are also encouraged to discover what they think
and how they have read by putting words on paper, and to see that
writing enables them to examine the text of their thinking
(Bartholomae and Petrosky 3). They practice informal and exploratory
writing as they inquire into issues about which they subsequently
write polished analyses and arguments. They practice translating and
reformulating what a text is saying and extending its argument by
relating it to something familiar. They practice revising their
writing in the light of their own re-reading as well as in response
to feedback from the instructor and others in the class. One goal of
the course is for students to learn that they can write with clarity
and force when they take responsibility for relating their own
interests to the material explored in the class.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >RWS 100 presents writing as
an occasion for inquiry and expression: students respond in writing
to others&rsquo; arguments with their own ideas, and investigate how
ideas may be related to one another. Focused research tasks are very
appropriate to the course. Students may be asked to research specific
questions, using the library or other sources, in order to enrich
course readings. They learn to determine when and where a source was
published, who wrote it, and whether it was reprinted or edited. They
learn to examine practices of citation in course readings and to
cite, contextualize and comment on sources in their own work. (See
Part C, Designing RWS 100 Library Research Assignments.)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >The course emphasizes that
rhetorical analysis includes issues of organization. It teaches that
determining the relationships among ideas and organizing material are
some of the decisions that a writer makes. Ordering ideas affects
both what one is arguing and how well one communicates it to others.
Students are asked to examine and articulate ways that writers have
ordered and connected ideas&mdash;how writers sometimes add,
contrast, subsume, draw conclusions from, separate, and so on&mdash;and
to see that boiler-plate organization models seldom work well to
formulate complex arguments.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >In RWS 100, students begin
to un-learn the five-paragraph theme and simplified thesis statement,
and to understand that writers make decisions about the structures
that are effective for their purposes. They see that professional
writing often does not contain easily identifiable theses, but rather
sets up problems and solutions, or ways to re-see or call into
question common ideas. Instructors may thus ask students to translate
complex passages into their own words or to write abstracts of the
arguments they read rather than simply to look for a main idea or
thesis statement.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >RWS 100 stresses the
influence of audience and social context on every piece of writing.
Instructors teach students to examine the arguments they read for
clues about the situation, community and culture in which these texts
were written. Instructors encourage students to recognize strategies
for appealing to audiences, including what ancient rhetoricians
called <I>ethos</I>, <I>pathos</I>, and <I>logos</I>. Writing
assigned in RWS 100 can be both public&mdash;intended for an
audience&mdash;and private&mdash;composed only for the writer.
Students are asked to explore how private writing frequently leads to
public work and is also valuable as a form of self-expression and
inquiry. They begin to learn that the self that a writer represents
on the page has been &ldquo;composed.&rdquo; Each writer can
therefore speak with many voices (depending upon the writing
situation), and cross boundaries and roles.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >The course teaches that most
kinds of public writing require careful attention to conventions of
correctness. Students investigate how grammar, syntax, usage, and
punctuation serve rhetorical and communicative functions. They begin
to learn how language and purpose interact. The course stresses that
writers take responsibility for revising and editing their own work,
at both discourse and sentence levels.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >In confronting grammar
questions, &ldquo;The challenge,&rdquo; as Margaret Marshall has
said, &ldquo;is to learn to read &lsquo;error&rsquo; not as a
violation of rules akin to sinning, but as a sign of a newly
developing, though not yet controlled, type of literacy&rdquo; (243).
By developing this kind of understanding, instructors can replace a
negative, remedial approach with the view that grammar is a
rhetorical tool for writers. While RWS 100 is not a grammar course,
it is appropriate for instructors to address issues of grammar in the
context of students&rsquo; writing and reading (see Elise Miller&rsquo;s
article on Grammar Instruction in this guide).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >Students are asked to
consult a writer&rsquo;s handbook regularly. The recommended handbook
for both RWS 100 and 200 is Ann Raimes&rsquo; <I>Keys for Writers: A
Brief Handbook</I> (Houghton-Mifflin).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >Students are asked to take
responsibility for their own words, both spoken and written, and to
investigate and acknowledge the power of language.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >In RWS 100, students read
and respond in writing to a variety of texts. The course models
reading for different purposes: reading for information; reading for
strategies of argumentation; reading for access to new ways of
framing issues; reading to inquire into a problem. It emphasizes that
mature writers habitually consult dictionaries and reference
materials. The course helps students work at and construct an
understanding of content by writing about it&mdash;in response to
prompts that show them what to do. Instructors emphasize that
confusion during reading is not a deficiency in the reader, but an
opening for examining and questioning content, argumentation,
ordering devices, and so on. Because readings take on added
significance in relation to one another, assignments are carefully
sequenced, and students are encouraged to re-read previous material,
and re-envision their interpretations and analyses. It is the passage
of time and the exposure to more ideas and methods that allow a
writer to come back to a former topic and re-envision and write about
it with new perspective and depth.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >RWS teaches that no text is
autonomous and that all writers draw upon other texts, including the
texts of their own histories and cultures, either directly or
indirectly to create new texts. Stated theoretically, this point may
seem overly complex. But it is intended to encapsulate the lively and
messy process of real writing, recalling that however a piece of
writing develops, it is not something utterly new, but a use of and
response to language that has come before it. This is true of
&ldquo;creative&rdquo; writing as well as &ldquo;academic&rdquo; and
&ldquo;real&ndash;world&rdquo; writing, distinctions which students
and instructors may well call into question.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal;  widows: 0; orphans: 0">
<FONT FACE="Georgia, serif"><FONT >By the end of the semester,
students should begin to understand&mdash;through practice&mdash;ways
in which the arguments of one author may be used as a frame for
interpreting and writing about the work of another author or about
their own experiences and observations. Because this activity is
fundamental to sustained inquiry and research, it forms the bridge
between RWS 100 and 200. RWS 200, with its focus on intertextuality,
returns to and expands this kind of work. All of the recommended
textbooks include assignments which call on students to find
relationships among the readings, to extend a writer&rsquo;s ideas or
terms or ways of seeing things to new situations or questions, and to
compare the methods of professional writers with their own ways of
writing. A glance at the assignment sequences in the textbook
<I>Literacies </I>, for example, will show this feature of RWS 100.</FONT></P>

<B>RWS 101</B>, which follows the prescribed Rhetoric and Writing
Studies 100 curriculum for students who have obtained a score of 146
or better on the EPT and 8 or better on the EPT essay.  In addition,
students are required to attend eight individual tutoring sessions
throughout the semester.</FONT></P>
