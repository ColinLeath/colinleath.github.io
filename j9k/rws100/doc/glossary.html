      <span class="">Any piece of written, spoken or visual language designed
     to bring about some change in a reader&rsquo;s, listener&rsquo;s or hearer&rsquo;s ideas or
     attitudes. An argument asks us to consider, believe or do something. It
     is a conclusion or claim based on evidence. In rhetoric, argument does
     not refer to a situation in which people are fighting. Rather, it refers
     to a situation in which people are making a case for a way of seeing
     things.</span></td>

      <span class="">One component of an argument. A claim is an arguable
     assertion. It is a conclusion based on information or data. To make a
     claim is to assert that something is the case. Usually it is possible to
     identify a claim that is the central point or conclusion that an argument
     makes. A claim may appear at the beginning or end of a text, but it may
     appear at any point in an argument, or it may not appear explicitly
     anywhere in the argument, in which case the reader must infer it from the
     evidence in the text. Often arguments make more than one claim. They
     sometimes also make one or more sub-claims. Claims are supported by
     reasons.</span></td>

     <span class="fnt3"><span class="label"><font
     color="#000000">Ethos</font></span></span></a></b> <br />
      <span class="">The character of the speaker or writer as it comes
     through in his or her words. For example, certain words or passages could
     create an ethos of trustworthiness, fair-mindedness, credibility,
     kindness, or humanity. Ethos is not a matter of who a writer really is,
     but is the character that emerges in his or her work. A writer could
     create a very different ethos in each of two different pieces of writing.
     Ethos is one category of rhetorical strategy and can overlap with pathos
     and logos. For example, well-chosen examples might make an argument
     (logos) seem reasonable, but they could also tap beliefs, values or
     experiences in an emotional way (pathos), and they could show the writer
     who chose them to be a person of a certain kind of character
     (ethos).</span></td>

     <span class="fnt3"><span class="label"><font
     color="#000000">Logos</font></span></span></a></b> <br />
      <span class="">The argument itself; the reasoning that a writer uses.
     Claims and reasons are elements of logos. So are examples and evidence,
     information and data, and conclusions drawn from them. Logos is a broader
     term than logic; it may include logic, but does not equate with logic.
     Logos is one category of rhetorical strategy and can overlap with ethos
     and pathos. For example, well-chosen examples might make an argument
     (logos) seem reasonable, but they could also tap beliefs, values or
     experiences in an emotional way (pathos), and they could show the writer
     who chose them to be a person of a certain kind of character

     color="#000000">Metadiscourse</font></span></span></a></b> <br />
      <span class="">Language about language. Often, metadiscourse announces
     what a paper will be about and what it will do. Metadiscourse can be used
     both to announce the overall project or purpose of the paper and to
     announce its argument.<br />
     <br />
      Metadiscourse also provides signposts along the way, guiding the reader
     to what will come next and showing how that is connected to what has come
     before.<br />
     <br />
      Metadiscourse announces what the writer is doing, helping you to
     recognize the author&rsquo;s plan.</span></td>

     <span class="fnt3"><span class="label"><font
     color="#000000">Pathos</font></span></span></a></b> <br />
      <span class="">Words or passages that activate emotions, usually because
     they relate to readers&rsquo; or hearers' deeply held values or beliefs. Pathos
     is not necessarily a strategy of writing about emotional subjects or of
     describing strong emotions. It is a strategy of using language in ways
     that evoke emotions in audiences. It is a strategy that may dispose the
     audience to have a certain attitude toward the writer, or to feeling that
     what the writer proposes is desirable or undesirable. Pathos is one
     category of rhetorical strategy and can overlap with ethos and logos. For
     example, well-chosen examples might make an argument (logos) seem
     reasonable, but they could also tap beliefs, values or experiences in an
     emotional way (pathos), and they could show the writer who chose them to
     be a person of a certain kind of character (ethos).</span></td>
