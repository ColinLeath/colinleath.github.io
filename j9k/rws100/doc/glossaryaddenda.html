Studying the Rhetoric of Written Arguments (Glossary Addenda)</b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b><i>Rhetoric</i> </b>
refers to the study, uses, and effects of written, spoken and visual
language.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Argument &#8211; </b>
any piece of written, spoken or visual language designed to bring about
some change in a reader&#8217;s, listener&#8217;s or hearer&#8217;s ideas or attitudes.
An argument asks us to consider, believe or do something. It is a
conclusion or claim based on evidence.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">In rhetoric, argument does not refer
to a situation in which people are fighting. Rather, it refers to a
situation in which people are making a case for a way of seeing things.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Components of argument include:</b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Claim &#8211; </b></font> </p>
<ul>
  <p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><i>Noun</i>: A claim is an arguable
assertion. It is a conclusion based on information or data. </font> </p>
</ul>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2"><i>Verb</i>: To make a claim is to
assert that something is the case.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">Usually it is possible to identify a
claim that is the <i>central </i>
point or conclusion that an argument makes. A claim may appear at the
beginning or end of a text, but it may appear at any point in an
argument, or it may not appear explicitly anywhere in the argument, in
which case the reader must infer it from the evidence in the text.
Often arguments make more than one claim. They sometimes also make one
or more sub-claims.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Reason (sometimes also called <i>grounds</i>
or <i>evidence </i>or <i>data</i>)</b></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">A reason is evidence, data or
information given to support a claim. To find reasons, ask why the
claim can be made. What have you got to go on? What evidence is there
to support this claim? </font></p>
<h1><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>How do you find these elements of
an argument? How do you read for them?</b></font></h1>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">One good practice is to map or chart
or annotate the kinds of work done by each paragraph or section or
subsection of an argument.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Examples of language describing
author&#8217;s <i>projects</i></b></font> </p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Barbara Ehrenreich is a journalist
whose project is to investigate first hand whether it is possible to
live on the wages paid to unskilled workers. She went to each of three
cities for one month, to see whether she could &#8220;match income to
expenses, as the truly poor attempt to do every day&#8221; (6).</font></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Alexander Stille is a journalist
whose project in &#8220;The Ganges Next Life&#8221; is to report on the
collaboration between a Hindu religious leader and a Berkeley professor
of engineering who both seek to clean up the Ganges River. His account
draws on interviews and a visit with these men to the site of a
clean-up project.</font></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Eric Schlosser is an investigative
journalist whose project in &#8220;Global Realization&#8221; is to report on three
years of research into the fast food industry as it extends American
values and business practices to other nations. To do the project,
Schlosser traveled to various countries that have McDonald&#8217;s
franchises, and interviewed McDonald&#8217;s employees and customers outside
the U.S., as well as people who protest McDonald&#8217;s presence in their
nations. He attended a convention of fast food businesses. In addition
to this first-hand research, he also collected data from written
history books, science publications and web-sites.</font></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Amy Chua is a professor at the Yale
Law School, specializing in international business and ethnic conflict
and globalization. In &#8220;A World on the Edge,&#8221; her project is to
investigate how the spread of free market economy and democracy
contributes to ethnic conflicts. The article was originally published
in the Autumn 2002 issue of <i>Wilson Quarterly</i>, a news magazine
about politics and foreign affairs, and was written for a lay audience.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Metadiscourse</b> is language about
language. Often, metadiscourse announces what a paper will be about and
what it will do. Metadiscourse can be used both to announce the overall
project or purpose of the paper and to announce its argument.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">Metadiscourse also provides <i>signposts</i>
along the way, guiding the reader to what will come next and showing
how that is connected to what has come before. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Examples from professional articles:</b></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">"In this essay, I examine in some
detail what we mean by . . . My primary purpose, however, is to create
a new, shared discourse for understanding X." </font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">"I want to explore a connection
between X &amp; Y . . ., but as I will suggest. . ."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">"My essay moves from an analysis of
this problem to case studies of [people] wrestling with it. My argument
is this: . . . . Such inquiry must start, as I will here, by
confronting the conflicts within . . ."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">"In what follows, I hope to complicate
X by demonstrating the social potential of both Y and Z. I contend
that. . . . I show how these attitudes emerge not only in response to A
but to B."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">"The following discussion sets out an
analysis and an illustration. The analysis identifies how several
claims cohere. . . . The illustration offers a formulation of what X
could be today."</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Student work on Chua: </b>
students can also use metadiscourse to describe their writing projects.
For example:</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">This paper further investigates
Chua&#8217;s argument by using additional sources about globalization in
order to clarify both the problem and implications that she describes.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">I begin with a brief description Amy
Chua&#8217;s project and what it asks readers to consider. I then move to a
discussion of additional resources that make her work more
understandable. </font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">To bring Chua&#8217;s argument about the
&#8220;explosive collision&#8221; of these forces into sharper focus, I explore two
additional sources. The first extends Chua&#8217;s argument, and the second
complicates it by showing another way to look at problems that emerge
with globalization. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"> <wbr> </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Additional examples of
metadiscourse in our course texts:</b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Chua, 113</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">The argument I am making is frequently
misunderstood. I do not propose a universal theory. . . . The point,
rather, is this: </font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Kaldor, 270</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">In this essay, I shall distinguish
between the different types of armed forces that are emerging in the
post-Col War world. . . </font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Scott, 522</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">I shall use the term <i>public
transcript</i> as a shorthand way of describing the open interaction
between subordinates and those who dominate.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Scott, 531</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Now that the basic idea of public and
hidden transcripts has been introduced, I will venture a few
observations by way of orienting the subsequent discussion. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Ehrenreich, 196</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">But the real question is not how well
I did at work but how well I did at life in general, which includes
eating and having a place to stay. The fact that these are two separate
questions needs to be underscored right away.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Ehrenreich, 204</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">But the resistance of employers only
raises a second and ultimately more intractable question: Why isn&#8217;t
this resistance met by more effective counterpressure from the workers
themselves?</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Examples of language describing
authors&#8217; arguments:</b></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">In <i>Nickel and Dimed </i>Ehrenreich
argues that America is not truly a democracy, but rather a &#8220;culture of
extreme inequality&#8221; (212), in which the unskilled work for less pay
than it is possible to live on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"> <wbr> <wbr> Or,</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">Ehrenreich argues against the
assumption that poverty is simply a result of unemployment. Rather, her
research shows that, for many employed people, poverty results from low
ages.</font> </p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">In &#8220;A World on the Edge,&#8221; Amy Chua
suggests that democracy, free market economies, and ethnic hatred are
&#8220;the three most powerful forces operating in the world today&#8221; (108). As
she investigates the relationship among these three forces, she makes a
two-part argument, proposing both a problem and a solution. Challenging
accepted notions about democracy and free markets, she argues that the
spread of these often fuels ethnic hatreds.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Context: </b>
the larger textual and cultural environment in which specific
rhetorical acts take place.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Here are some ways in which DRWS
instructors may talk about the term <i>context:</i></b></font> </p>
<ol type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">We can think about a source <i> in
the context</i> of the publication where it appeared.</font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">Publication data: where was a source
published? What sort of publication is that? What is its readership?
What are the interests/themes/methods of that publication? Does the
source text provide any clues to the readership and their interests? </font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">For example, Amy Chua&#8217;s &#8220;A World on
the Edge&#8221; was originally published in the <i>
Wilson Quarterly</i>, a journal that many students and instructors
aren&#8217;t familiar with.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2"> A quick Google search turns up this
magazine&#8217;s website, which says, &#8220;By presenting the best writing and
thinking of academics, specialists, and others to a broad audience,
[the Wilson Quarterly] aims to overcome the specialization and
information overload that prevent the public from following
developments in significant realms of knowledge. The magazine ranges
over many subject areas but always with an eye to public questions:
issues in politics and policy, culture, religion, science, and other
fields that bear upon our public life.&#8221; </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">This tells us that the article was
written by a specialist, but for a lay audience interested in knowing
about a range of topics. We could check the table of contexts of an
issue of the magazine to get a better feel for what those topics are.</font>
</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">We can think about a source <i> in
the context</i> of the author&#8217;s life, persona and work.</font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">Author&#8217;s life: who wrote the work?
Who is that person? When and where does/did that person live? What do
we know about his/her other work, activities, methods, public
appearances, reputation? Does the source text include any clues about
the author&#8217;s life and works?</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">For example, Robert Coles, in &#8220;The
Tradition: Fact and Fiction,&#8221; provides readers with several anecdotes
about his practice as a psychologist and his experiences with other
psychologists, authors, and documentarians, providing clues about his
reputation and work.</font> </p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">We can think about a source <i> in
the context</i> of the other work available since rhetorical acts don&#8217;t
happen in a vacuum, but usually respond to and engage with other
discussions that are going on about a particular topic. We can ask,
does the source text include any references to or clues about the
ongoing discussion? </font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">For example, Ronne Hartfield, in her
introduction to <i>Another Way Home: The Tangled Roots of Race in One
Chicago Family</i>, positions her book in relation to contemporary work
on mulattoness, naming five recent books that address this topic in
ways that are different from her own approach (page xiv). </font> </p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">We can think about a source <i> in
the context</i> of past ideas, discoveries, theories, research, and
writing about a topic.</font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">Sometimes writers refer to past work
which may be an important antecedent for their arguments. The source
text may include references to or clues about this past work. For
example, Martin Luther King in &#8220;Letter from a Birmingham Jail&#8221; refers
to Socrates and Ghandi as sources of ideas about non-violent protest. </font>
</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">We can think about a source <i> in
the context</i> of specific events and audiences.</font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">Rhetorical acts address audiences
and respond to particular events or situations. Sometimes these
audiences are quite specific. For example, Martin Luther King, in his
&#8220;Letter from a Birmingham Jail,&#8221; addresses a specific audience of
clergy about the lunch counter protests that were happening in
Birmingham. </font></p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">Mark Hertsgaard, in &#8220;The Oblivious
Empire,&#8221; responds to the events of 9/11 and the question &#8220;why do they
hate us&#8221;?</font> </p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">We can think about a text <i> in
the context</i> of its reception.</font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">How did people respond to the work
when it was published? Was it well received? Were people shocked?</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">For example, the reception of Martin
Luther King&#8217;s &#8220;Declaration of Independence from the War in Vietnam&#8221; was
hostile in some circles, with people calling King a traitor.</font> </p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">We can think about a text <i> in
the context </i>of common assumptions about the topic.</font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">For example, in &#8220;Appearances,&#8221; John
Berger begins his argument concerning the meaning of photographs by
addressing how most viewers are used to experiencing photography in
certain ways.</font> </p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">We can think about a source <i> in
the current social context</i> in which we are reading: our own locale,
the events that are present to us, our own experiences.</font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">For example, looking at James Agee
and Walker Evans&#8217; <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>, readers may be
able to read the images of white Depression-era migrants differently
when seen in the context of the current political climate concerning
the felonization of immigration.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2"><b>Context: a useful discussion by
rhetoricians Faigley and Selzer:</b></font> </p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">In <i>Good Reasons: Designing and
Writing Effective Arguments</i> (Longman 2006), Lester Faigley and Jack
Selzer describe <i>textual</i> and <i>contextual </i>
analysis, two approaches to rhetorical analysis that roughly correspond
to RWS 100 and 200:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">[G]enerally approaches to rhetorical
analysis can be placed between two broad extremes&#8212;not mutually
exclusive categories but extremes along a continuum. At the one end of
the continuum are analyses that concentrate more on texts than
contexts. They typically use rhetorical concepts to analyze the
features of texts. Let&#8217;s call this approach <i>textual analysis</i>.
At the other extreme are approaches that emphasize context over text.
These emphasize reconstructing the cultural environment . . . that
existed when a particular rhetorical event took place, and then depend
on that re-creation to produce clues about the persuasive tactics and
appeals. Those who undertake <i>contextual analysis</i>&#8212;as we&#8217;ll call
this second approach&#8212;regard particular rhetorical acts as parts of
larger communicative chains, or &#8220;conversations&#8221; (63)</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">They add:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Georgia" size="2">[<i>C</i>]<i>ontextual rhetorical
analysis always proceeds from a description of the </i>
<b><i>rhetorical situation</i></b><i> </i>
that motivated the item in question. . . . It regards communications as
anything but self-contained:</font> </p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Each communication is considered as
a response to other communications (and to other social practices.)</font></li>
</ol>
<ol start="10" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Communications (and social
practices) are considered to reflect the attitudes and values of the
communities that sustain them.</font></li>
</ol>
<ol start="11" type="1">
  <li><font face="Georgia" size="2">Evidence is sought about how those
other communications (and social practices) are reflected in texts.</font></li>
</ol>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">Rhetorical analysis from a
contextualist perspective understands individual pieces as parts of
ongoing conversations.</font></p>
<p> <font face="Georgia" size="2">The challenge is to reconstruct the
conversation surrounding a specific piece of writing of speaking
(69-70).</font> </p>
