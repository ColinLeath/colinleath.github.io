<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">Loffreda</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">In “<i>Selections from </i>
Losing Matt Shepard,” Beth Loffreda examines the significance of Matt 
Shepard’s murder and why it captured the nation’s attention. As 
she investigates the nature of the media coverage and the various responses 
of individuals and groups, she uncovers a wide array of prejudices, 
not only about gays, but about Wyoming, the West, and Native Americans, 
thus revealing a multifaceted problem.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">For this project, construct an account 
of Loffreda’s argument. In your paper, make clear how, in Loffreda’s 
view, the media frenzy, the community’s response, and the undercurrent 
of prejudices in Laramie create a multifaceted problem. Discuss how 
Loffreda organizes the piece and how the structure influences what she 
has to say.  Finally, how is what she has to say significant for 
people interested in identity?</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Georgia"><b>Project #2 – Gathering Information 
and Managing Sources</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">Hartfield, <i>Another Way Home:  
The Tangled Roots of Race in One Chicago Family</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">Ronne Hartfield’s memoir, <i>Another 
Way Home:  The Tangled Roots of Race in One Chicago Family</i>, 
chronicles the histories of her biracial family, in hopes to “make 
visible how one colored family created meaningful lives” (xvi).  
In contrast to existing tragic narratives within black literature, she 
makes clear the need for more celebratory stories.  Through this narrative, 
she argues that the stories she tells “have implications both for 
history and for how we live now” (xiii).  She makes connections 
between her particular family experiences and larger moments in African 
American history in order to illustrate these possible implications.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">After reviewing and evaluating the 
sources provided for you as part of this assignment, <b>choose a minimum 
of two</b> that help you understand Hartfield’s narrative accounts 
and her argument that there is a meaningful relationship between individual 
family histories and larger sociohistorical moments.  How do those 
sources illustrate, clarify, extend, or complicate the argument that 
this piece makes—or the questions it raises—about the interplay 
between racial identity, family narratives, and the wider historical 
atmosphere?  How do they contribute to your ideas about the significance 
of Hartfield’s argument?</font> <br></p>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">Krakauer and Sacks research and write 
about the lives of individuals who see and experience the world differently 
from the way many people do and who may even be said to confront a different 
reality. To describe and explain the way issues of identity are experienced 
by their research subjects, Krakauer and Sacks employ various rhetorical 
strategies.  Identify some of the rhetorical strategies that Krakauer 
and Sacks use to present their representations of lives that may seem 
different in the eyes of many of their intended readers.  Propose 
an explanation of some strategies that writers like these use to make 
it possible for us to connect not only to new information, but to people 
whose perspectives and sense of identity may differ significantly from 
our own.  Be sure to comment on the significance of these authors’ 
work for writers and/or for people interested in understanding identity.</font> <br>

<p><font size="2" face="Georgia"><b>Assignment #4: Reading in New Contexts</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">Scott and Abu-Lughod</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Georgia">James C. Scott provides an approach 
to reading and understanding what occurs whenever the powerful and the 
disempowered engage with one another.  Abu-Lughod, in telling Kamla’s 
story, describes complex relations among Bedouins and between Bedouins 
and outsiders: youths versus tradition-oriented elders, Bedouin tribes 
versus Egyptians, Bedouins versus Europeans, and so forth.  You 
have already charted the organization of Abu-Lughod’s essay in order 
to understand her project and to construct the argument that she is 
making.  Now consider that argument in terms of James C. Scott's 
&quot;Behind the Official Story.&quot; How would Scott interpret the 
stories that Kamla has told?  How many different transcripts are 
present in “Honor and Shame?” Who is best positioned to interpret 
these transcripts?  How is the work of these researchers significant 
for understanding identities?</font> <br></p>

  <li><font size="2" face="Georgia">consider Abu-Lughod’s 
  examination of Kamla’s life and of women’s lives in the traditional 
  Bedouin community in terms of Scott's argument, presenting examples 
  that could be understood as dominant and hidden transcripts in Abu-Lughod’s 
  text;</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Georgia">draw conclusions about to

  Shame&quot; and what the various transcripts reveal about the connection
