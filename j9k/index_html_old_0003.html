<h3>What I Do</h3>
<p>I pass the time well.</p> 
<p>I work as a <i>facilitator</i> for money and for fun. I facilitate team building on the challenge course at the <a href="http://www.kroccenter.com/">Kroc Center</a>.</p>

<p>I do what I can to realize the visions I describe below. I incorporate development of personal virtue and social virtue into my facilitation. Personal virtue strengthens individual vitality. Social virtue strengthens vitality of communities and societies.</p>

<p>I study literature at San Diego State University. I will be tutoring composition students, and later will teach composition classes. Eventually I may teach in private high schools or in community colleges in California or Mexico. Or develop carfree communities, or establish schools on ecovillages.</p>

<h3>The visions</h3>
<ul><li>A dialog along the lines of &ldquo;Who are my people, where are we going, and what is my part in it?&rdquo; becomes active and widespread.</li>
<li>More people spend more time listening to the silence and to those who listen to the silence. The silence shall speak through more minds.</li></ul>

<h3>The feral ballerina</h3>
<p>I am looking for a woman who lives near SDSU who would like to be a coconspirator. She may be a <a href="http://purl.org/net/cfu/Members/colin/personal001/">feral ballerina</a>.</p>

<h3>Things I've worked on</h3>
<ul>
<li>A portal for the carfree: <a href="http://purl.org/net/cfu/">carfreeuniverse</a></li>
<li>A U.S. Carfree city: <a href="http://carfreecity.us/">carfreecity.us</a></li>
<li>A social group for carfree/carfree-leaning people who live near San Diego State University: <a href="http://carfreeclub.org/">CarfreeClub.org</a></li>
<li><a href="http://purl.oclc.org/net/ea/">experienceart</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Affirmations</h3>
<ul>What shall my affirmations be? 
<li>"My entire being is vital, balanced, and healthy." - George Leonard &amp; Michael Murphy's <a href="http://purl.org/net/cfu/Members/colin/itpKata/">ITP Kata</a></li> 
<li>"The world is well made." / "el mundo est&aacute; bien hecho" - Jorge Guillén (en su poema <i><a href="http://palabravirtual.com/index.php?ir=ver_poema1.php&amp;pid=4594">Beato sill&oacute;n</a></i>) </li>
<li>"All responds joyfully."</li> 
<li>"I respond joyfully."</li> 
<li>"I love."</li>
<li>"The world teaches me how to help it become what it is becoming."</li> 
</ul>

<h3>More on facilitation</h3>
<p>
"My intention is that the short time that we spend together provoke in you many hours of valuable experience. Help me learn to do that. ...help me to help you experience new ways of being. Help me to learn from you new ways of being, and help all of us to be reminded of valuable old ways."</p>

<ul>I challenge some of my groups to consider the following questions:
<li>Who are my people, where are we going, and what is my part in it?</li>
<li>What is the greatest challenge I will face in life, and how will I prepare for it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Send me your responses and I will start to collect your answers and publish them!</p>

<p>I structure the group's experience as a good dance instructor leads a dance class: there is warm up, there is emotional intensity and range, there is challenge, there is a feeling of care throughout, there is a cool down. There is a meaningful, moving, union-, peace-, or serenity-inducing conclusion.</p> 

<h3>The most important thing I have to tell you is</h3>
<p>Note when you're having a good time. When times are hard, having done so will help you continue to love living. Kurt Vonnegut suggests we say, &ldquo;If this isn't nice, I don't know what nice is.&rdquo;</p>
