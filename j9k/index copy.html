  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>I continue to think of Ethan Hughes and the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=possibility+alliance">Possibility Alliance</a>&mdash;they live without using cars, computers, or electricity. For now, I am using two of those.</p>
  <p>Here I publish what I write, draw, and record.</p> 
  
<p>My muse has got me to buy a one-way ticket to Amsterdam on July 1. My plan is to head to Berlin by 7/12 to participate in the <a href="http://www.ecotopiabiketour.net/">ecotopia bike</a><a href="http://btwiki.ecobytes.net/Biketour_2013">tour</a>. One larger goal is to remain abroad until I learn how to support myself without returning to the US to raise funds. Another goal is to live in a land that retains more artefacts from the time before cars. I may make it to Greece, Turkey, and Israel for the winter.</p>

<p>I want to make art others may pay to support or access.</p>

<p>One needs to address others' deepest needs and desires in order to sucessfully sell them something.</p>
What are your needs and desires? 
<ul>
<li>Do you want to feel healthy?
</li><li>Do you wish to spend time with people in interesting ways in beautiful places?
</li><li>Do you desire to live in a land where few or no people use cars?
</li><li>Do you wish to balance peace of mind with creative engagement?
</li></ul>

<p>In January 2013 I ended the outdoor education work I had been doing. I began to seek a way of living that fit better with my personality. Previous to spending $719 on that plane ticket, my plan was to live out the year in the Goleta / Santa Barbara area without working for money and to watch what happened as I did that. Events conspired to get me to choose to get myself to Europe in time for the bike tour rather than to participate in <a href="http://bit.ly/ipmlead">a training</a>. Buying the ticket left me with about $600. Since then, I've made $1016 by working for temp companies and by cleaning apartments.</p>

<p>The carbon offset for the flight <a href="http://terrapass.com/carbon-footprint-calculator-2/#action">is less than $20</a>. I haven't bought it yet. Years ago Ethan and his partner made a trip to Europe to visit communities there. They sailed, I believe. And there is a big old &ldquo;one less plane&rdquo; logo on the bike tour web site. I decided, in spite of all that, to plan to fly. I see where I may be able to take a cruise back to the US in the fall or the spring for $500&mdash;or less if I share my cabin&mdash;but I saw no easy way and did not have the faith or the desire to try a non-flying solution. I didn't wish to <a href="http://purl.org/net/cfu/Members/colin/vowOfStability/">stay still</a> any longer. I'd known about the bike ride for years and had wanted to participate for as long. <a href="http://plantsandhealers.org/">One of my teachers</a> was a grateful user of airplanes. I don't wish to apologize but to describe my reservations.</p>

<p>In the interest of transparency, I'll document incomes and outgoes here. At least for the time being.</p>
<p>Well, I wrote it all up, but it seems to be for me in the category of secrets to attempt to sell. Let me explain how I imagine that working.</p>

<H1>Here's What's Free:</H1>

<a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7am_p8rWoN1dDl0OGx4YkNMSlE/">ColinLeath.com content</a>

<p>
</p>

<H1>Here's what I'm selling and how to pay for it:</h1>

Content types: 
<ul>
<li><b>PDFs of scans of letters.</b> Available from 5/27. At least four per month, approximately weekly.</li>
<li><b>MP3s of voice and ambient sound recordings.</b> Available from 5/9/2013. Often daily. Access to these is delayed one month to allow some distance/privacy.</li> 
<li><b>PDFs of scans of sketches.</b> As inspiration strikes. Some demo sketches will be available at some point.</li>
</ul>
<p>A list of all content available for access will soon be here.</p>

<p>Content access options:
<ul>
<li>Access to two months of content. You will have lifetime access to content offered here that is created within the two-month date range you specify. &euro;10 (~$13) <form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="MNWD6BTRN2962">
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1">
</form>

</li>
<li>Lifetime access to all content offered here. &euro;120 (~$156) <form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="6B8AAXLKM958U">
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1">
</form>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Access</b> consists in being able to access the files in google drive-- you'll need to sign in with the email address you specify to access the links I send you in emails. Access is not instant--I'll need to login and manually give you access to the files. You will not be charged until that happens. In addition, if you've specified a date range that ends in the future, content will continue to become available within that range for up to a month past the last date of the range. For example, a recording dated June 30, 2013 may not be available until July 30, 2013.</p>
<p><b>Lifetime</b>: my lifetime. But you'll be able to save a copy of the files to your own google drive or elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Euros (&euro;).</b> Currently (6/02/2013) 1 Euro = 1.3 USD. Your bank (often no fee) or PayPal (fee) can convert the currency. Bitcoin and other options may be offered in the future.
<p>In the future I hope to make it possible to pay for access to individual content items and to own the hard copies (the original, paper versions) of letters and sketches.</p> 
<p>A list of some previous expeditions and links to some content created during them can be found in the "Other Experience" section of <a href="cv/index_html_2013-05-06.html">this archived resume</a>. </p>
